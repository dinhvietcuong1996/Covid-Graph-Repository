Paper title: Optimized Construction of Covid-19 Datasets for GraphAnalytics

This repository contains a number of Covid-19 graph database dumps.
- Graph-Dumps/1-Dimensional-Graph.dump: This includes metamodel transformation, node compression and binning.
- Graph-Dumps/2-Edge-Compression-Graph.dump: This is a Dimensional Graph with the added feature of Edge Compression.
- Graph-Dumps/3-Hyper-Edge-Compression-Graph.dump: This is an Edge Compression Graph with the added feature of HyperEdge Compression
- Graph-Dumps/Rolling-Window-Graphs/Dimensional-Compression-Rolling-Window-Graph.dump
